LIRI the new SIRI

LIRI is here to help.  You can ask it to complete tasks for you. Start by opening the terminal. Make sure you install the modules by typing in npm install.  This will install Twitter, Spotify, Request and Require NPM Packages. You can type in node liri.js + one of the following commands:
    - my-tweets & a twitter handle or see mine
    - spotify-this-song & enter a name of the song or check out Ace of Base's The Sign
    - movie-this & enter a movie or check out Mr. Nobody's
    - do-what-it-says: this will read a text file and run the song
